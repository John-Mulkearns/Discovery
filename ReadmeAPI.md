#  WORK IN PROGRESS

# Client

Extracts from dev log.
âœ“. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.0.

âœ“. Initial client registration implemented  as  a template form changed from  to Reactive Form.

âœ“. Reactive Reuseable Reactive form Controls used to replace initial reactive inputs.

âœ“. Client side validation added with user feedback and custom validator.

âœ“. Basic password requirements maintained for dev's simple          interactions as user.

âœ“. Simple i18n functionality added thus far
comment: Returning the what server side detection of the accept language finds in the client request header to a general client application wide angular service
is a fairly standard approach to deciding what language to present the opening screen and controls in, with the lazy loading of feature based modules
it suggest the translated "labels" be loaded along with other feature components as part of the lazy approach.
If the user selects another language other than that first detected then updating other requested features already loaded will be needed. 

âœ“. Form builder service added to initialize registration form.

## incomplete

âœ—. Spinning wheel of patience not added yet

âœ—. Further toaster popups delayed

âœ—. photoUrl prop missing from client model added but not documented in wiki


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).



This project serves to demonstrate the application of specific areas of technology involved in the
construction of a full stack Angular plus .NET Web Application.

The project involves the extensive and repeated use of the Dotnet and Angular CLIâ€™s and 
at least one IDE.

Whilst many developers prefer either Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code my experience
preference is not to make a binary choice. Visual Studio can be a little harder to configure
but once it is setup there are no significant issues.

My personal preference is to use both, sometimes together. Visual Studio has clearly more
debugging features and doesn't require restarting, Visual Studio Code, along with the CLI's
are quicker to navigate and seem to consume less memory.


The remainder of this document will be a two column table like
structure, with the technical features on
the left and the area/s where they were applied within the Web Application on the right
